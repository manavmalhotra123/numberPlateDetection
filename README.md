# **OpenCV Project - Number Plate Detection**
---
### This repository contains Python code for real-time number plate detection using OpenCV. The code utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier, specifically trained for detecting Russian license plates. When a license plate is detected, it is highlighted with a rectangle and its region of interest (ROI) is shown in a separate window. The user can also save the detected license plates by pressing 'p' on the keyboard.

## Usage :
### 1. Download the "haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml" Haar Cascade classifier file and place it in the "Resources" folder of the project.
### 2. Connect your webcam to your computer or use an external camera.
### 3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
### 4. Run the Python script: python NumberPlate_detection.py
### 5. The webcam feed will open, and the number plate detection will start in real-time.
### 6. When a license plate is detected, it will be highlighted with a green rectangle, and its ROI will be displayed in a separate window.
### 7. Press 'p' on your keyboard to save the detected license plate image. The saved images will be stored in the "Resources/Scanned_Number_Plates" folder.
### 8. Press 's' on your keyboard to stop the detection and exit the program.
